# 🎡 🎯 Guess the color

This is a simple app to guess a color from three prompts of hexadecimal colors.

- You get a div with a random color background, and try to guess it by clicking on one of the prompts.

## ✅ Concepts learnt/covered

This was actually fun because I learnt something new - how to use [enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html) in typescript.

- I hadn't used them prior to this challenge, but turns out they are interesting/fun to work with.
- Other concepts used are the basics:
  - React
    - The useEffect Hook
    - State management (the simple aspect of it, not the complex one 🥲)
    - Conditional rendering
  - TypeScript
    - Interfaces
    - Enums
