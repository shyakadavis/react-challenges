# 🖱️ 🔵 Click it

A fun game-ish app that lets you click anywhere on the screen, and draws a circle there.
It also allows you to do undo's and redo's via two buttons on opposite diagonals of the screen.

## 🍔 Tech Stack

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - A free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A modern, blazing-fast tool for scaffolding and bundling projects—quickly
- [pNPM](https://pnpm.io/) - Fast, disk space efficient package manager

## ✅ Concepts learnt/covered

There was no third-party package or API. Just handling logic and states.
It had been a while since I last tried the JS [Splice Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice), and I can definitely see myself using it more and more, as opposed to the more-verbose alternatives.
I initially wanted to try out the [At Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/at) but I am leaving it for another future challenge.
